ActiveShell is a shell for the Web.

An ActiveShell session is identified by a URI and accessed using a browser.

It can be used like a Unix shell to manage files on remote systems accessible by SSH, like an REPL for exploratory programming, and can access any networked service for which a port has been implemented.

Installation
------------

The shell UI itself is contained entirely in prototype.html.
However, the shell creates a session and for that session to persist there must be a server that handles PUT requests.
Any server that accepts HTTP PUT requests, and returns the same data on a subsequent GET, is sufficient.
