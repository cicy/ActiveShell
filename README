ActiveShell is a shell for the Web.

It can be used like a Unix shell to manage files on remote systems accessible by SSH, like an REPL for exploratory programming, and can access any networked service for which a port has been implemented.

Principles
----------

Ad-hoc reuse is beautiful.

Automate automation.


Installation
------------

The shell UI is in prototype.html.
However, the shell creates a session and for that session to persist there must be a server that handles PUT requests.
Installation on Node.js using nhttpd and revstore is the easiest approach:
